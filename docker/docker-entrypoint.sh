# The `set -Eeo pipefail` option controls the behavior of the script on errors:
# - `set -E` ensures that any ERR traps are inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and commands executed in subshells.
# - `set -e` exits the script immediately if any command within the script or a subshell returns a non-zero status (indicating failure).
# - `set -o pipefail` causes the script to fail if any of the commands in a pipeline fail, not just the last command.

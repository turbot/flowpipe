## v0.5.0 [2024-06-02]

_What's new?_

* Add support for installing mods from a branch or from the local file system. ([#849](https://github.com/turbot/flowpipe/issues/849)).

    To install from a branch:
    ```
    flowpipe mod install github.com/turbot/flowpipe-mod-aws-thrifty#main
    ```
    To reference a mod in the local file system:
    ```

    ```

- Add `--pull` flag to `mod` command to control the mod update strategy. ([#849](https://github.com/turbot/flowpipe/issues/849)). Possible update strategies are:

    - `full` - check branch and tags for both latest and accuracy
    - `latest` - update everything to latest, but only branches - not tags - are commit checked (which is the same as latest)
    - `development` - update branches and broken constraints to latest, leave satisfied constraints unchanged
    - `minimal` - only update broken constraints, do not check branches for new commits
